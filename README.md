# Flight Fare Prediction Project
## Overview-

This project is centered on building a machine learning model to predict financial portfolio performance. 
It involves data analysis, predictive modeling, and portfolio optimization techniques to enhance investment strategies and decision-making processes.


## Features-

Data Preprocessing: 
Cleaning and preparing financial data for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying trends, outliers, and key patterns.

Model Building: Implementation of predictive models to forecast portfolio performance.

Model Evaluation: Assessing model accuracy with performance metrics and visualizations.

## Prerequisites-

To run this project, ensure the following libraries are installed:


Python 3.0, 
Pandas, 
Numpy, 
Scikit-learn, 
Matplotlib / Seaborn (for data visualization), 
Jupyter Notebook (for working with the .ipynb files), 

You can install the necessary packages using the following command:

Copy code- pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

## How to Run- 

Clone the repository to your local machine:

Copy code- git clone https://github.com/your-username/financial-portfolio-prediction.git

Navigate to the project directory:

Copy code- cd financial-portfolio-prediction

Open the Jupyter Notebook to explore the analysis and model development:

Copy code- jupyter notebook FPP_final.ipynb

Run the notebook cells to execute the code for financial portfolio prediction.

## Project Structure- 

FPP_final.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the full implementation of the portfolio prediction model.
